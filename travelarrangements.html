    <h1>Travel Arrangements to prival island resort</h1>
    <p>Private Island Resort is easily accessible. Fiji’s international airport at Nadi is serviced by many international carriers, with flights from North America, Europe via Hong Kong, Japan via Guam, Korea, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
    <p>From Nadi International Airport, Nukubati Island is a 40 minute domestic airline flight to Fiji’s northern capital town, Labasa, and then a one hour adventurous drive through coconut plantations, rice fields and Fijian villages to Nukubati’s jetty, followed by a 5 minute boat ride to the island</p>
    <p>Nowadays, many guests make their own travel arrangements, booking airlines, hotels and resorts on the internet. Your stay at Nukubati can be booked on this website or you can email us direct for availability and specials. Your booking with Nukubati includes complimentary return transfers from Labasa airport to the island and are co-ordinated with your booking.</p>
    <p> you are booking your international flights on Fiji Airways (www.fijiairways.com) , you can also get through fares/bookings to Labasa. (Fiji Airways is the parent company of Fiji’s domestic airline, Pacific Sun). Otherwise, you can book your Nadi/Labasa/Nadi flights separately from your international flights on <a href="www.flights.com">flights.com</a></p>
    <p>Should you require overnight or dayroom accommodation at Nadi, our sister property, The Fiji Orchid, is just 25 minutes North of Nadi International Airport (www.fijiorchid.com). Your Fiji Orchid stay can be booked in combination with Nukubati Island.</p>
